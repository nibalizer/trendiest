Trendiest
---------


Trendiest is a simple daemon that watches directories and manages a symlink named 'latest' which always points to the most recently modified file in the directory. This is useful for pointing at your Downloads or screenshots folder.


Examples:
---------


```
# Download powerpoint presentation

libreoffice ~/Downloads/latest
```


```
# Take screenshot

feh ~/Pictures/latest
```

```
# insert usb stick
# Download ubuntu iso 
sudo dd if=~/Downloads/latest of=/dev/sdb # Probably don't actually do this
```


Details
-------

Trendiest uses inotify to get file events. It fires once the file has been closed for writing. It uses a new symlink and a move operation to atomically replace the target symlink. There shouldn't be any race conditions but YMMV.


Installation
------------

Unfortunately, the state of inotify python libraries is not great. There is an old unmaintained version packaged for debian, and a new unpackaged version on pypi. My solution to this is to create a virtualenv for the daemon and run it out of there with systemd.
